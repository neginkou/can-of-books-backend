**Author**: Negin Koushkakinejad
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. In this module, we are creating a small app called "Can of Books" to track the books that have impacted us and to get recommendations for what to read next. This app will serve as a personal library where users can document their reading journey and discover new books.

## Getting Started
epositories:
Create can-of-books-frontend from front-end template.
Create can-of-books-backend from back-end template.
Add all team members as collaborators.
Local Setup:
Clone repositories locally.
Review and align .gitignore files.
Add blank .env files (gitignored).
Collaboration:
Use Driver-Navigator strategy.
Changes via pull requests from named branches.
Regularly switch roles for equal contributions.
Deployment:
Deploy front-end and back-end to the cloud.
Verify proof-of-life indicators.
Use these deployments for subsequent labs.

## Architecture

The Can of Books app is designed as a client-server application. The front end is built using technologies and libraries from the front-end template, and the back end uses technologies from the back-end template. The communication between the client and server is established through RESTful APIs. The technologies include [list technologies and libraries used].
